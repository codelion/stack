## Naming Conventions

### Use Clear and Descriptive Names

- Choose meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes that accurately describe their purpose or functionality.
- Avoid abbreviations or cryptic names that may confuse other developers.

### Ensure Consistency in Component Naming

- Use correct and consistent import names for components across the project.
- Example: Use 'SignIn' instead of 'UserButton' for a sign-in component.

## Code Structure

### Maintain Consistent Formatting

- Use consistent indentation and formatting throughout the codebase.
- Follow established coding style guidelines for the programming language being used.

### Organize Imports and Components

- Use appropriate imports from the correct packages (e.g., '@stackframe/stack').
- Organize components into separate files or modules for better code organization and maintainability.

## Documentation

### Write Clear Comments

- Provide clear and concise comments for complex code sections and functions.
- Explain the purpose and functionality of the code, not just restate what the code does.

### Maintain Accurate Headers

- Ensure header names and content in documentation are accurate and consistent.
- Use appropriate heading levels to create a clear hierarchy of information.

### Create Meaningful Pull Request Descriptions

- Write PR titles and bodies that directly address the documentation changes being made.
- Clearly explain the purpose and impact of the changes.

### Link to Relevant Discussions

- Include links to relevant discussions in Discord or other communication channels.
- Indicate where review and agreement on changes have taken place.

### Ensure Accurate Code Snippets

- Maintain up-to-date and accurate code snippets in documentation.
- Test code snippets to ensure they work as intended.

### Include Visual Representations

- Add visual representations (images) alongside code examples when appropriate.
- Use proper image references in Markdown format.
- Example: `![Sign-in Component](../imgs/sign-in.png)`

## Error Handling

### Implement Proper Error Handling

- Implement appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms throughout the codebase.
- Catch and handle exceptions gracefully to prevent application crashes.
- Log errors with sufficient detail to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

## Performance

### Optimize Critical Code Sections

- Identify and optimize critical sections of code for better performance.
- Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
- Consider factors such as time complexity, memory usage, and resource utilization.

## Security

### Follow Secure Coding Practices

- Adhere to best practices for secure coding to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization.
- Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Keep sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords, out of the codebase.
- Regularly update dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities.
