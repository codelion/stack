## Naming Conventions

### Use Descriptive Names

- Choose clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood.

### Follow Language-Specific Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions in JavaScript.
- Use PascalCase for class names in most object-oriented languages.
- Use snake_case for variables and functions in Python.

### Consistency is Key

- Maintain consistent naming patterns throughout the project.
- Use singular nouns for objects and plural nouns for collections.

## Code Structure

### Keep Functions Small and Focused

- Aim for functions that do one thing well.
- Limit function length to improve readability and maintainability.

### Use Meaningful Indentation

- Consistently use either spaces or tabs for indentation.
- Maintain proper indentation to clearly show code structure.

### Organize Related Code

- Group related functions and classes together.
- Use modules or namespaces to organize larger codebases.

## Documentation

### Write Clear Comments

- Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Avoid commenting on self-explanatory code.

### Maintain Up-to-Date Documentation

- Keep README files, API documentation, and inline comments current.
- Document any changes to public interfaces or important internal logic.

### Use JSDoc or Similar Tools

- Utilize documentation generators for consistent API documentation.
- Include parameter types, return values, and brief descriptions.

## Error Handling

### Use Specific Exception Types

- Create or use specific exception types for different error scenarios.
- Avoid using generic exceptions when more specific ones are available.

### Provide Meaningful Error Messages

- Include clear, actionable information in error messages.
- Consider including error codes for easier troubleshooting.

### Implement Proper Error Logging

- Log errors with appropriate severity levels.
- Include relevant context information in error logs.

## Performance

### Optimize Critical Paths

- Identify and optimize performance-critical sections of code.
- Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

### Consider Resource Usage

- Be mindful of memory usage, especially for large datasets.
- Implement pagination or lazy loading for large collections.

### Use Appropriate Data Structures

- Choose the right data structure for the task to optimize performance.
- Consider time and space complexity when selecting algorithms.

## Security

### Validate User Input

- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use parameterized queries for database operations.

### Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization

- Use secure, industry-standard authentication methods.
- Implement role-based access control for sensitive operations.

### Keep Dependencies Updated

- Regularly update third-party libraries to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use automated tools to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
