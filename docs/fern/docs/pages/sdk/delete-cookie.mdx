# deleteCookie

Deletes a cookie with the specified name. This function attempts to delete the cookie using server-side methods first, and falls back to client-side deletion if necessary.

## Parameters

- `name`: `string` - The name of the cookie to delete.

## Example

```tsx
import { deleteCookie } from '@stackframe/stack';

// Delete a cookie named 'session'
deleteCookie('session');

// Delete another cookie named 'preferences'
deleteCookie('preferences');
```

Note: This function handles both server-side and client-side cookie deletion automatically.
