# deleteCookie

Deletes a cookie by its name. It first attempts to delete the cookie using `rscCookies`. If that fails due to the cookie being unavailable, it falls back to using `Cookies.remove`.

## Parameters

- `name`: `string` - The name of the cookie to be deleted.

## Example

```tsx
import { deleteCookie } from '@stackframe/stack';

// Deleting a cookie by name
deleteCookie('session');
```
