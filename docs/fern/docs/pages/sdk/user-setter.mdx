# UserSetter

The `UserSetter` function sets the current user in the application using a promise that resolves to user data. This function is typically used within a React component to manage user state.

## Parameters

- `props`: `object`
  - `userJsonPromise`: `Promise<CurrentUserCrud['Client']['Read'] | null>` - A promise that resolves to the current user data or `null`.

## Example

```tsx
import { UserSetter } from '@stackframe/stack';

const userPromise = fetchUserFromApi(); // Assume this returns a promise that resolves to user data

function App() {
  return <UserSetter userJsonPromise={userPromise} />;
}
```
