# UserSetter

Sets the current user based on a promise that resolves to a user object. Returns `null` as it is a functional component that performs a side effect.

## Parameters

- `props`: `Object`
  - `userJsonPromise`: `Promise<CurrentUserCrud['Client']['Read'] | null>` - A promise that resolves to a user object or `null`.

## Example

```tsx
import { UserSetter } from '@stackframe/stack';

const userPromise = fetchUser(); // Assume fetchUser returns a promise resolving to a user object or null

<UserSetter userJsonPromise={userPromise} />
```
