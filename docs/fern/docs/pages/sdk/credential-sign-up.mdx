# CredentialSignUp

A React component that renders a sign-up form for user registration using email and password credentials. It handles form validation, submission, and displays error messages.

## Usage

```tsx
import { CredentialSignUp } from '@stackframe/stack';

function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign Up</h1>
      <CredentialSignUp />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `CredentialSignUp` component automatically handles form state, validation, and submission. It uses the `useStackApp` hook internally to access the Stack application instance for user registration.

When the form is submitted successfully, it attempts to sign up the user with the provided email and password. If there's an error during sign-up, it will be displayed in the form.

The component includes fields for email, password, and password confirmation, along with appropriate labels and error messages.It handles form validation, displays error messages, and manages the sign-up process using the Stack SDK.
