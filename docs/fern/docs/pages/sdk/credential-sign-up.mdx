# CredentialSignUp

The `CredentialSignUp` component provides a user registration form where new users can sign up with their email and password. It handles form submission, validation, and displays error messages if there are any issues.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignUp } from '@stackframe/stack';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Sign Up</h1>
    <CredentialSignUp />
  </div>
);
```

## Props

The `CredentialSignUp` component does not accept any props. It internally manages state and form handling using hooks and context from `@stackframe/stack`.

## Usage

To use the `CredentialSignUp` component, simply import it and include it in your JSX. The component handles all form logic, including validation and submission, for you.

## Example with Styled Components

Here is an example of using `CredentialSignUp` with some additional styles:

```tsx
import { CredentialSignUp } from '@stackframe/stack';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const SignUpContainer = styled.div`
  max-width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 40px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  border-radius: 8px;
`;

const App = () => (
  <SignUpContainer>
    <h2>Create an Account</h2>
    <CredentialSignUp />
  </SignUpContainer>
);
```
