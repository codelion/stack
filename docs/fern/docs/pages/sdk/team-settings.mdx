# TeamSettings

Renders a team settings component with various sections such as profile, members, and team information. Returns a React component displaying team settings, either as a full page or embedded content.

## Parameters

- `props`: An object containing the following properties:
  - `fullPage` (optional): `boolean` - Determines whether to render the settings as a full page or embedded content.
  - `teamId`: `string` - The ID of the team to display settings for.

## Example

```tsx
import { TeamSettings } from '@stackframe/stack';

// Render as embedded content
const EmbeddedTeamSettings = () => (
  <TeamSettings teamId='team-123' />
);

// Render as full page
const FullPageTeamSettings = () => (
  <TeamSettings teamId='team-456' fullPage={true} />
);
```

This component uses the `useUser` and `useTeam` hooks internally to fetch and manage user and team data. If the team is not found, it displays a 'Team not found' message. The settings are organized into sections including 'My Profile', 'Members', and 'Team Info', which are rendered using a `SidebarLayout` component.
