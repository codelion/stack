# UserButton

A React component that renders a user button with loading state handling. It displays a skeleton while loading and the actual user button content when data is available.

## Parameters

- `props`: `UserButtonProps` - An object containing properties for the UserButton component.

## Example

```tsx
import { UserButton } from '@stackframe/stack';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <UserButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `UserButton` component handles its own loading state, so you don't need to manage it externally. Simply render the component where you want the user button to appear.```
