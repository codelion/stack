# TeamCreation

Renders a form for creating a new team. This component handles the team creation process, including form validation and submission.

## Parameters

- `fullPage` (optional): `boolean` - Determines whether the component should be rendered in full-page mode.

## Example

```tsx
import { TeamCreation } from '@stackframe/stack';

// Render TeamCreation component
function App() {
  return (
    <TeamCreation />
  );
}

// Render TeamCreation component in full-page mode
function FullPageApp() {
  return (
    <TeamCreation fullPage={true} />
  );
}
```

The `TeamCreation` component will render a form with a display name input field and a submit button. It handles form validation, submission, and redirects to the team settings page upon successful team creation.- `useRouter` for navigation

It also checks if team creation is enabled in the project configuration. If not, it displays a message card instead of the form.

When the form is submitted, it creates a new team with the provided display name and redirects the user to the team settings page.
