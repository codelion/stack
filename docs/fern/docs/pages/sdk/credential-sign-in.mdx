# CredentialSignIn

The `CredentialSignIn` component provides a form for users to sign in using their email and password. It handles form validation, submission, and error display.

## Usage

Import the `CredentialSignIn` component from `@stackframe/stack` and include it in your JSX.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <CredentialSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Description

- The component uses the `useForm` hook from `react-hook-form` with a Yup resolver for validation.
- It integrates with the `useStackApp` hook to access the app context and perform sign-in operations.
- The form includes fields for email and password, and displays validation errors.
- On form submission, it calls the `signInWithCredential` method from the app context with the provided email and password.
- Displays a loading state while the sign-in operation is in progress.
- Shows a link to the forgot password page.

## Props

This component does not accept any props.
