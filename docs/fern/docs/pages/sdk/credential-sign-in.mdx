# CredentialSignIn

A component that provides a sign-in form using credentials (email and password). Uses form validation with Yup and the `useForm` hook from React Hook Form. Integrates sign-in functionality from `@stackframe/stack`.

## Usage

This component renders a sign-in form with email and password fields. It handles form submission and shows error messages if the credentials are invalid.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className='app'>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <CredentialSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `CredentialSignIn` component handles the form with the following steps:

1. Registers form fields using the `useForm` hook.
2. Submits the form data to the `signInWithCredential` method from the stack app context.
3. Displays error messages if there are validation issues or sign-in failures.
4. Shows a loading state while the submission is processing.

This component does not require any props and is ready to use as-is.
