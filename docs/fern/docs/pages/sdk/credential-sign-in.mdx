# CredentialSignIn

A React component that renders a sign-in form for credential-based authentication. It handles form submission, validation, and displays error messages.

## Usage

This component doesn't accept any props. It uses internal state and the Stack App context for handling the sign-in process.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';

function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <CredentialSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `CredentialSignIn` component renders a form with email and password inputs, a 'Forgot password?' link, and a submit button. It handles form validation, submission, and displays error messages if the sign-in fails.

The component uses the `useStackApp` hook internally to access the Stack App instance for authentication.
