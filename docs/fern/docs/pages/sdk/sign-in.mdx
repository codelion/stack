# SignIn

The `SignIn` component renders a sign-in page within your application using the SDK's `AuthPage` component.

## Parameters

- `fullPage`: (Optional) A boolean indicating whether the sign-in page should take up the entire page (`true`) or not (`false`). The default value is `false`.

## Example Usage

```jsx
import { SignIn } from 'your-sdk-name';

// Render a sign-in form as part of the current page
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
    <SignIn />
  </div>
);

// Render a sign-in form that takes up the whole page
const FullPageSignIn = () => (
  <SignIn fullPage={true} />
);
```

This component is useful for scenarios where you need to provide a sign-in interface for users, either embedded within a page or as a full-page form.
