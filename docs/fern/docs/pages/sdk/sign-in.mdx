# SignIn

The `SignIn` function renders an authentication page for users to sign in. It utilizes the `AuthPage` component, passing in the `fullPage` property to determine if it should be rendered as a full page or not.

## Parameters

- `fullPage`: (Optional) A boolean value. If `true`, the sign-in page is rendered as a full page. Default is `false`.

## Example Usage

```jsx
import { SignIn } from 'your-sdk-name';

// Render a sign-in page that is not full page
const signInComponent = <SignIn />;

// Render a sign-in page that is full page
const fullPageSignInComponent = <SignIn fullPage={true} />;
```

The `SignIn` function is primarily used in applications where user authentication is required. It provides a seamless way to integrate a sign-in page into your application, with an option to display it as a full-page experience.
