# MaybeFullPage

A component that optionally renders its children within a full-page container. If `fullPage` is true, the children are wrapped in a container that adjusts its height to fill the viewport.

## Parameters

- `children`: `React.ReactNode` - The content to be rendered inside the component.
- `fullPage` (optional): `boolean` - A flag to determine if the content should be rendered in a full-page container. Defaults to `true`.

## Example

```tsx
import { MaybeFullPage } from '@stackframe/stack';

const App = () => (
  <MaybeFullPage fullPage={true}>
    <div>Your content here</div>
  </MaybeFullPage>
);

const AppWithoutFullPage = () => (
  <MaybeFullPage fullPage={false}>
    <div>Your content here</div>
  </MaybeFullPage>
);
```
