# MaybeFullPage

Renders a component that can be displayed in full-page mode or as a standard component.

## Parameters

- `children`: `React.ReactNode` - The content to be rendered inside the component.
- `fullPage`: `boolean` (optional) - Determines if the component should take the full page height. Defaults to `true`.

## Returns

`JSX.Element` - A component that either takes the full height of the page or just renders its children based on the `fullPage` parameter.

## Example

```typescript
import { MaybeFullPage } from '@stackframe/stack';

function App() {
  return (
    <MaybeFullPage fullPage={true}>
      <div>Your content goes here</div>
    </MaybeFullPage>
  );
}
```
