# MagicLinkSignIn

Renders a form for users to sign in using a magic link sent to their email. The form handles validation, submission, and displays appropriate messages based on the state.

## Example

```tsx
import { MagicLinkSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <MagicLinkSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This component uses the `useForm` hook from `react-hook-form` for form handling and validation, and `useStackApp` from `@stackframe/stack` to send the magic link email.

The form includes:

- An email input field
- A submit button that sends the magic link
- Validation and error handling for the email field
- Loading state management during form submission
- Success message when the email is sent
