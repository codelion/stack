# MagicLinkSignIn

A form component that allows users to sign in using a magic link sent to their email. Utilizes form validation and submission handling.

## Example

```tsx
import { MagicLinkSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <MagicLinkSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Usage

To use the `MagicLinkSignIn` component, import it into your project and include it within your JSX. The component handles form registration, submission, and error display internally.

The form includes an email input field and a submit button. Upon submission, a magic link is sent to the provided email if it is valid.

- **Email Input**: The user must provide a valid email address.
- **Submit Button**: Sends the magic link to the provided email address.

The component uses `useForm` from `react-hook-form` for form management and `yup` for validation schema resolution.

## External Dependencies

- `react-hook-form`
- `yup`

These dependencies are necessary for form validation and handling within the `MagicLinkSignIn` component.
