# MagicLinkSignIn

A React component that provides a form for magic link sign-in functionality. It handles form submission, sends a magic link email, and manages the UI state.

## Usage

This component can be used directly in your React application to render a magic link sign-in form.

## Example

```tsx
import { MagicLinkSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';

function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <MagicLinkSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Component Details

- Uses `useForm` hook for form management
- Handles form submission and error states
- Sends magic link email using `app.sendMagicLinkEmail`
- Provides UI feedback for form submission and email sent state

The component renders a form with an email input field and a submit button. It handles the entire magic link sign-in process internally.
Note: This component relies on the Stack App context and should be used within a Stack App provider.
